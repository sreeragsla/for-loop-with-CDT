iteration
1.controller will take 's' and check whether it is present in s.'s' is present in s
  so increment will happen and c will goes 0 to 1 and stored
2.it will take 'r' and check whether it is present in s.'r' is present in s so
  increment will happen and c will goes 1 to 2 and stored
3.it will take 'e' and check whether it is present in s.'e' is present in s so
  increment will happen and c will goes 2 to 3 and stored
4.it will take 'e' and check whether it is present in s.'e' is present in s so
  increment will happen and c will goes 3 to 4 and stored
5.it will take 'r' and check whether it is present in s.'r' is present in s so
  increment will happen and c will goes 4 to 5 and stored
6.it will take 'a' and check whether it is present in s.'a' is present in s so
  increment will happen and c will goes 5 to 6 and stored
7.it will take 'g' and check whether it is present in s.'g' is present in s so
  increment will happen and c will goes 6 to 7 and stored
8.after iteration controller will come out of the loop and printing c
